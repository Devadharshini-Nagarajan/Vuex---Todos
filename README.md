# Vue Todo App

Welcome to the Vue Todo app! This application allows users to manage their todo list using Vue.js and Vuex for state management. Users can perform basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on todos, including fetching todos from JSONPlaceholder (jsonplaceholder.typicode.com), adding new todos, marking todos as completed by double-clicking, and removing todos by clicking on the clear button.
